    "[Previously](https://beckernick.github.io/music_recommender/), I used item-based collaborative filtering to make music recommendations from raw artist listen-count data. I had a relatively small amount of data, and ended up making some pretty good recommendations. Collaborative filtering methods that compute distance relationships between items or users are generally thought of as \"neighborhood\" methods, since they center on the idea of \"nearness\". Unfortunately, there are two issues with taking this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It doesn't scale particularly well to massive datasets\n",
    "2. There's a theoretical concern with raw data based approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "I talked about the scaling issue in the previous post, but not the conceptual issue. The key concern is that ratings matrices may be overfit and noisy representations of user tastes and preferences. When we use distance based \"neighborhood\" approaches on raw data, we match to sparse low-level details that we assume represent the user's preference vector instead of the vector itself. It's a subtle difference, but it's important.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I've listened to ten Red Hot Chili Peppers songs and you've listened to ten different Red Hot Chili Peppers songs, the raw user action matrix wouldn't have any overlap. We'd have nothing in common, even though it seems pretty likely we share at least some underlying preferencs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it sounds like using song features (such as genre) could help, you're right. But, to steal Joseph Konstan's (professor at Minnesota involved with GroupLens Research who has an awesome [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/recommender-systems) on Recommender Systems) example, what if we both like songs with great storytelling, regardless of the genre. So, how do we resolve this? I would need a method that can derive the tastes and preference vectors from the raw data.\n",

    "# Matrix Factorization via Singular Value Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix factorization is the breaking down of one matrix in a product of multiple matrices. It's extremely well studied in mathematics, and it's highly useful. There are many different ways to factor matrices, but singular value decomposition is particularly useful for making recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is singular value decomposition (SVD)? At a high level, SVD is an algorithm that decomposes a matrix $R$ into the best lower rank (i.e. smaller/simpler) approximation of the original matrix $R$. Mathematically, it decomposes R into a two unitary matrices and a diagonal matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    "R = U\\Sigma V^{T}\n",
    "\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where R is users's ratings matrix, $U$ is the user \"features\" matrix, $\\Sigma$ is the diagonal matrix of singular values (essentially weights), and $V^{T}$ is the movie \"features\" matrix. $U$ and $V^{T}$ are orthogonal, and represent different things. $U$ represents how much users \"like\" each feature and $V^{T}$ represents how relevant each feature is to each movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the lower rank approximation, we take these matrices and keep only the top $k$ features, which we think of as the underlying tastes and preferences vectors.\n"

It's also good to see that, though I didn't actually use the genre of the movie as a feature, the truncated matrix factorization features \"picked up\" on the underlying tastes and preferences of the user. I've recommended some film-noirs, crime, drama, and war movies - all of which were genres of some of this user's top rated movies."

    "We've seen that we can make good recommendations with raw data based collaborative filtering methods (neighborhood models) and latent features from low-rank matrix factorization methods (factorization models).\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-dimensional matrix recommenders try to capture the underlying features driving the raw data (which we understand as tastes and preferences). From a theoretical perspective, if we want to make recommendations based on people's tastes, this seems like the better approach. This technique also scales **significantly** better to larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we still likely lose some meaningful signals by using a lower-rank matrix. And though these factorization based techniques work extremely well, there's research being done on new methods. These efforts have resulted in various types probabilistic matrix factorization (which works and scales even better) and many other approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "One particularly cool and effective strategy is to combine factorization and neighborhood methods into one [framework](http://www.cs.rochester.edu/twiki/pub/Main/HarpSeminar/Factorization_Meets_the_Neighborhood-_a_Multifaceted_Collaborative_Filtering_Model.pdf). This research field is extremely active, and I highly recommend Joseph Konstan's Coursera course, [Introduction to Recommender Systems](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/recommender-systems), for anyone looking to get a high level overview of the field. The optional readings are influential papers in the field from the last 15-ish years, and they're really cool."
